        <li>
            1 (8 ounce) package lasagna noodles

        </li>

        <li>
            1 (16 ounce) container sour cream

        </li>
            
        <li>
            2 (12 ounce) packages shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
        </li>

        <li>
            ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese

        </li>

        <li>
            ½ cup chopped pitted green olives
        </li>

        <li>
            3 large eggs, lightly beaten

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
        </li>

        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, and garlic in a large skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain any excess grease. 
        </li>
        <li>Stir in diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, parsley, basil, oregano, and sugar. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 30 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li> When the sauce has simmered for about 15 minutes, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain. 
        </li>
        <li>Stir sour cream, 1/2 of the mozzarella, Parmesan, olives, eggs, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. 
        </li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna: Spread a thin layer of meat sauce evenly over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 1/3 of the lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the remaining meat sauce, and 1/3 of the cheese mixture; repeat layers two more times with remaining noodles, sauce, and cheese mixture. Sprinkle remaining mozzarella evenly over top. 
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and the cheese is golden brown, about 30 minutes. 
        </li>
    </ol>
